%description
Xpp is a package for the visualization of motion plans for floating-base robots.
Apart from drawing support areas, contact forces and motion trajectories in
RVIZ, it also displays these plans for specific robots. Current robots include a
one-legged, a two-legged hopper, HyQ and a quadrotor.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
